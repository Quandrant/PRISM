## Characters of PRISM

## Ariadne Cordova (Universe A1)

Ariadne Cordova is an undergraduate student in her early 20s working on the Systematic Euclidean Entering of Realms project. She is a workaholic and a studious researcher but called too ambitious for her own good. She has used the SEER mainframe the most, and is the one who consistently produces high-quality output. She cares about all the people she ports and scrys into. During the Colors arc, Ariadne becomes the host for / makes a deal with Green and can influence the B3 universe, albeit as Green, and not herself (though the distinction between the two is intentionally blurry).

### Ariadne Cordova (Universe A2)

Ariadne Cordova is a woman in her late 20s living in the year 2120. She has an avid interest in photography and literature. She discovered SEE\*R while browsing through some online livestreams and was shocked at how realistic the gameplay was. Ariadne soon fell down a rabbit hole, and she figured out that the livestream wasn't pointed at a game, but at a wholly different universe. (The trans-universal technology had existed in her world for some time, but was not revealed to society.) She has since built an image/video-to-text AI to write out descriptions of the livestream when she cannot watch it herself, allowing her to skim swathes of activity and advise Betty on her next move. Eventually, Ariadne goes on an odyssey of her own to the SEE\*R machine itself to investigate further.

### Betty Bergeron (Universe B3)

Betty Bergeron is a 75 year old Mage with the hat to match living in the year 2720. She is one of the scant few remaining members of the "Impure", people who cannot receive anti-aging treatment due to her genes (and, implied, her magic system). Though the social stigma against flawed people has since died out in the last few decades of her life, Betty is still an oddball on a world filled with the eternally young. As Betty faces off neurodegeneration and a range of perceptual issues, she must also come to terms with her impending death.

### Ladon Solana (Universe B3)

Originally the guardian of the Hesperides before his untimely death, Ladon Solana in B3 is a 23 year old reincarnating mortal (functional immortal) and a close friend of Betty's. Ladon has loose but extensive knowledge of B3 from his past lives, though this particular life finds him very impulsive and very dogmatic. This explosive combination comes to a head in the Colors arc when he makes a bad deal with Orange and whisks them off to a long-forgotten lighthouse off the town of Calinas. [Luckily, Ladon and Orange both change for the better](https://archiveofourown.org/works/51219757). After leaving the island, Ladon's magic goes haywire and puts him out of commission until the final battle with Lux.

### Orange (Universe B3)

The literal incarnation of the color orange, and generally a complex individual. On his debut, Orange grants wishes to the townspeople but cruelly twists them at the last moment. Orange has a difficult relationship with Ladon at the beginning of the deal but becomes a devoted ally by the time they leave the island. I don't know what happens to Orange after the Colors arc ends; maybe he becomes human, or he just sticks around, or both. His inverse is Blue; his predecessors/parents/primaries are Red and Yellow.

### Blue (Universe B3)

The literal incarnation of the color blue. Stoic, refined, and brilliant, Betty makes a deal with her after Ladon goes missing. Blue's notable ability is her Vision, which allows her to see any thing, person, or place at the current moment. Her inverse is Orange.

### Green (Universe A/B)

The literal incarnation of the color green. Commanding "crazy time powers" and stories, Green is the modern Calliope. Green has an anchor in Ariadne of A1, but this remote anchor precisely makes her Universe B presence unreliable; that is, Green can only appear in very select circumstances, and is often described second-hand.

### Avatar Hawthorne Kalbraxas (Universe B0)

The beginning, and the end. The last avatar of the d.bot canon. Something of a guest star in the SEER ports (oneshots? leaves?). Current resident of the Space Between; possible framing story device.
