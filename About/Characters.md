## Characters of PRISM

### Ariadne Cordova (Hibiscus Universe)

Ariadne Cordova is a young woman in her 20's. She lives in the year 2120. She has an avid interest in photography, literature, and strangely enough, the obscure game Minecraft. She discovered SEE\*R while browsing through some online livestreams and was shocked at how realistic the gameplay was. One thing led to another, Ariadne fell down a rabbit hole, and she figured out that she was looking at wholly different universe. (The technology exists in her world, but has yet to be revealed.) She has since coded an AI to write out descriptions of the livestream when she cannot watch it herself, allowing her to skim swathes of activity and advise Betty on her next move.

### Betty Bergeron

Betty Bergeron is 78 year old Mage with the wits and the hat to match. She is one of the few remaining members of the "Impure", or the genetically unfortunate to receive anti-aging treatment. Though the social stigma against genetically flawed people has since died out in the last few decades of her life, Betty is still an oddball on a world filled with the eternally young. She relies on magical mnestics to combat her memory issues, but it is apparent that her low-tier wand (the specialized Class Item of the Mage) cannot produce the spells strong enough to ward off the rapid degeneration of her mind.

### Ladon

Ladon also calls himself Orange and is a dear friend of Betty.
