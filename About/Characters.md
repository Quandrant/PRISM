## Characters of PRISM

### Ariadne Cordova (Universe A)

Ariadne Cordova is a young woman in her 20's. She lives in the year 2120. She has an avid interest in photography, literature, and strangely enough, the obscure game Minecraft. She discovered SEE\*R while browsing through some online livestreams and was shocked at how realistic the gameplay was. Ariadne soon fell down a rabbit hole, and she figured out that the livestream wasn't pointed at a game, but at a wholly different universe. (The trans-universal technology exists in her world, but has yet to be revealed to society.) She has since coded an AI to write out descriptions of the livestream when she cannot watch it herself, allowing her to skim swathes of activity and advise Betty on her next move. Though Ariadne is not as obsessed to SEE\*R as she was prior to PRISM, she still retains an interest in the mysterious technology. Eventually, Ariadne goes on an odyssey of her own to the SEE\*R machine itself to investigate further.

### Betty Bergeron (Universe B)

Betty Bergeron is 78 year old Mage with the wits and hat to match. She lives in the year 2720. She is one of the few remaining members of the "Impure", or the genetically and magically unfortunate to receive anti-aging treatment. Though the social stigma against flawed people has since died out in the last few decades of her life, Betty is still an oddball on a world filled with the eternally young. Naturally there are health issues that come with that, but the most concerning involves her mind. Betty's unluckiness extends to her wand also, and as of recently, she cannot produce the spells strong enough to ward off the rapid degeneration of her mind. As Betty struggles to find a way to keep her memories intact, she must also come to terms with her impending death.

### Ladon Solana (Universe B)

Originally the guardian of the Hesperides, Ladon is an 19 year old immortal and a close friend of Betty's. He can shapeshift into a dragon! Because he is the last link in a long cycle of the same reincarnated person, Ladon has loose but extensive knowledge of the history of Universe B--far more than can be said for Universe A. He sometimes surprises Betty with his innate knowledge. Ladon tends to get in trouble often, but this characteristic comes to a head in the Colors arc where he's abducted and taken to the town's long-forgotten lighthouse. Ladon and Orange change for the better on the island, but when they leave, all the parallel timelines cascade into him and incapacitate him. He is out of commission until the final battle against Lux, where he becomes Nyx, the color black.

### Orange (Universe B)

The literal incarnation of the color orange--and a sharp one at that! He grants wishes to the townspeople but cruelly twists them and ruins their life. He has a difficult relationship with Ladon at the beginning, but it's only after many incidents that the pair start to make amends.
