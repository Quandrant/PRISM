#### What is PRISM?

PRISM is a GitHub repository containing the many "branches" and extra "leaves" of the SEE\*R writing project. PRISM serves to simplify the writing project and make it more accessible to my own skills.

PRISM is also the external narrative name for the mechanism by which all the branches and leaves of the SEE\*R Project are connected together into a cohesive whole.

#### What is SEE\*R?

SEE\*R is the internal narrative name for a mysterious terminal in Ariadne's universe with the ability to peer into universes similar to the host universe. Currently, SEE\*R is only focused on Betty's universe.

SEE\*R stands for the **S**ystematic **E**uclidean **E**ntering **of** **R**ealms. 

SEE\*R was also external narrative name for the entire project, but is now deprecated for favor of the new name, PRISM.

#### What are leaves and branches?

Prior to PRISM, there were "branches" that were alternative forms of the source material. They are the logical application of a computer science concept over to literature. PRISM may reduce the number of branches listed, or make them very small.

Branch X was an internally "lost" branch containing the source material itself and planned to be available only to me. It was written in second person and hosted in a Discord channel.

Branch Y was a testing ground to see which concepts would work in the story. It was written in third person and hosted on Archive of Our Own.

Branch Z was surreal, but still the closest to the source. It was also written in second person and hosted on Google Docs.

Branch C was a podcast investigating the SEE\*R Project of Ariadne's world and was written in a mix of first and third person as per usual from a podcast. It was hosted on Wattpad.

Branch D was a screenplay written by the character Ariadne Cordova, who was at the time the lone member of the in-universe SEE\*R Project. It was also hosted on Wattpad, but with radical stylistic changes to make it look more like a screenplay.

Leaves are extra scenes or chapters that don't belong in any (one) branch. In the event there are more leaves to handle, they will be moved to another repository for convenience.

#### What about darren.bot?

darren.bot is no more. Interestingly, this revamp also widens the divide between darren.bot and PRISM, as this "is a story to be told, not a game to be played with aimlessly".

#### So what's changed with PRISM?

Some things.

1. The SEE\*R is less of a communication platform and more of a one-way looking glass. It's still a terminal, though.
2. Betty is still functionally an avatar for the SEE\*R, but is no longer bound to the rules of the terminal recording her every move.
3. Ariadne's influence on Betty's universe is both enhanced and diminished; she can only directly communicate with Betty through a decrepit landline in her house.
4. The diversity of SEE\*R's mediums is no more; everything will be on GitHub in the form of Markdown files.
5. SEE\*R is no longer the name for the entire narrative, PRISM is.
6. PRISM isn't an acronym. (Hopefully.)

#### What happened to the Vegas Room?

I'll tell you personally once we have a chance to meet in there. (Yes, that was a joke!)

#### What about the Space Between?

Excellent question. The Space Between is unchanged. The blue sky and wheat field still sways, the lone cloud still hangs, and Hawthorne Kalbraxas's ghostly essence still remains.

*This is by design.*

The Space Between is it's own narrative with it's own rules. It's a small list, but one that even I have to follow. Because of this, the Space Between cannot be affected by changes in the structure of any single narrative.

#### Will the d.bot constructs and the Five still be active in PRISM?

What about them?

Snark aside, PRISM is now fully isolated from the memetic influences of other works. There will be no investigation of pataphysics or memetics in this story.

While the d.bot constructs are uniquely powerful artifacts in their own right, they are still anchored to their home narrative--which has been completed for some time now! Same goes for the Five. They make good villains, sure, but they're hard to handle.

I will be retroactively changing the current PRISM Branches to meet this criteria.
