#### What is PRISM?

PRISM is a GitHub repository containing the many "branches" and extra "leaves" of the SEE\*R writing project. PRISM serves to simplify the writing project and make it more accessible to my own skills.

PRISM is also the external narrative name for the mechanism by which all the branches and leaves of the SEE\*R Project are connected together, into a cohesive whole.

#### What is SEE\*R?

SEE\*R is the internal narrative name for a mysterious terminal in Ariadne's universe with the ability to peer into universes similar to the host universe. In the events of the narrative, SEE\*R is only focused on Betty's universe.

#### What are leaves and branches?

Prior to PRISM, there were "branches" that were alternative forms of the source material. These are a bit like developmental branches in programming, but above all they are the logical application from computer science to literature. PRISM may reduce the number of branches listed, or make them very small.

Branch X was a "lost" branch containing the source material itself and planned to be available only to me. It was written in second person.

Branch Y was a testing ground to see which concepts would work in the story. It was written in third person.

Branch Z was surreal, but was still the closest to the source. It was also written in second person.

Branch C was a podcast investigating the SEE\*R Project of Ariadne's world and was written in a mix of first and third person as per usual from a podcast.

Branch D was a screenplay written by the character Ariadne Cordova, who was at the time the lone member of the in-universe SEE*R Project.

Leaves are extra scenes or chapters that don't belong in any one branch or any at all. In the event there are more leaves to handle, they will be moved to another repository for convenience.

#### What about darren.bot?

darren.bot is no more. This revamp serves to further widen the divide between darren.bot and PRISM, as this "is a story to be told, not a game to be played with aimlessly".

SEE*R is still a terminal, but it's not one that can influence or command Betty in any way. Betty is functionally an avatar, but is bound by the rules of her own universe than the ones of Ariadne's.

#### So what's changed with PRISM?

A lot of things.

1. The SEE\*R is less of a communication platform and more of a one-way window.
2. Ariadne's influence on Betty's universe is both enhanced and diminished; she can only directly communicate with Betty through a decrepit landline in her house.
3. SEE\*R is no longer the name for the entire narrative, PRISM is.
4. The diversity of SEE\*R's mediums is no more; everything will be on GitHub in the form of Markdown files.
5. PRISM isn't an acronym.
