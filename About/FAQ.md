#### What is PRISM?

PRISM is a GitHub repository containing the many "branches" and extra "leaves" of the previously named "SEE\*R" writing project. PRISM serves to simplify the writing project and make it easier to write, by centralizing all the branches and leaves.

The name "PRISM" refers to how optical prisms can split white light into a rainbow spectrum, and integrate it back into white light.

#### What is SEER?

SEER is the subdiegetic in-universe mechanism by which characters can peer into other dimensions. Currently, SEER is only focused on Betty's universe, B1.

In the early days of this project, SEER was an experimental mainframe fitted with Researcher Ariadne Cordova's C-terminal for ease of use.

Nowadays, SEER is a strange and hidden terminal that hobbyist Ariadne Cordova is trying to locate.

  As a writer, I have difficulty choosing between these two variants of SEER. With the rise of large language models, I'm coming back around to the original conception of SEER as a powerful mainframe and remote dimension tool.

SEE\*R was also superdiegetic IRL name for the entire project. It is now deprecated for favor of the new name, PRISM.

#### What are leaves and branches?

Before the PRISM revamp, this writing project had many "branches" that were alternative forms/derivatives of the source material, leading to a very weak canon interpretation of things. Although the intent was to provide a multifaceted picture of the story's events, the lack of a single canon entirely confused even me! PRISM then has reduced the number of working branches and simplified their events.

Here's an overview of some of the branches before PRISM:

Branch X was an internally "lost" (unavailable to the readers) branch containing the source material itself and only available to me. It was written in second person and hosted in a Discord channel.

Branch Y was a testing ground to see which concepts would work in the story. It was written in third person and hosted on Archive of Our Own.

Branch Z was surreal, but still the closest to the source. It was also written in second person and hosted on Google Docs.

Branch C was a podcast discussing the SEER Project of Ariadne's world and was written in a mix of first and third person as per usual from a podcast. It was hosted on Wattpad.

Branch D was a screenplay written by the character Ariadne Cordova, who was at the time the lone member of the in-universe SEE\*R Project. It was also hosted on Wattpad, but with radical stylistic changes to make it look more like a screenplay.

Leaves are extra scenes or chapters that don't belong in any (one) branch, or even the PRISM narrative at all. In the event there are too many leaves to handle, they will be moved to another repository for convenience.

#### What about d.bot?

d.bot is no more. Michelle Ngo's "mOrphO" and my PRISM are the direct successors to it.

Philosphically, this revamp widens the divide between d.bot and PRISM. d.bot was a game; PRISM is a (story of a) story.

#### Can you summarize these (and other) changes in the PRISM revamp?

1. The in-universe SEER mainframe is not bidirectional. It functions as a one-way looking glass from the host dimension (A1) to the remote dimension (B1, etc.)
2. Betty is still an "avatar" in the sense of being a sensorimotor locus but otherwise the SEER's descriptions are not as embodied.
3. Betty's own magical abilities make her resistant to extradimensional (SEER) and mesodimensional (Colors) influence
4. Ariadne can only communicate with Betty through an old landline in her attic.
5. PRISM uses local Markdown files.
6. PRISM is the new name of the narrative.
7. PRISM is not an acronym (hopefully).

#### What happened to the Vegas Room?

No need for the Vegas Room. :-)

#### What about the Space Between?

The main reason why the Space Between is unchanged from the d.bot interpretation of it (blue sky, wheat field, one cloud, Hawthorne) is because it was never a subordinate component of the d.bot or PRISM narratives. The Space Between is it's own narrative with it's own rules. Humorously, this makes all of these works crossovers by technicality.

In the story, the Space Between is the complete opposite of a false reality. It is more "real" to the characters and offers a brief break.

#### Will the d.bot constructs and the Five Agents still be active in PRISM?

Nope, and I don't plan on employing them significantly. PRISM might reference these as easter eggs but for the most part, those stories are over.

This also means the Five Agents (Black's Figure, Goop, Wooden God, etc.) will not be in PRISM. This also frees up room for the Colors, and their arc.

---

I will be retroactively changing the current PRISM Branches to meet this criteria.
