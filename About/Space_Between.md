## The Space Between

Rules of the Space Between...

1. The Space Between can neither be affected by external nor internal influences.
2. The Space Between is not your pocket dimension.
3. The Space Between cannot be accessed easily.
4. The Space Between is not subject to any narrative-altering changes, such as the PRISM overhaul.

The thing you need to know most is that, although the Space Between operates independently of other narratives, it still retains unique connections to each of them. It's called the "Space Between" and not the "White Hallway" for a reason.
