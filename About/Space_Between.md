## The Space Between

Rules of the Space Between...

1. The Space Between can neither be affected by external nor internal influences.
2. The Space Between cannot be accessed easily.
3. The Space Between is not subject to any narrative-altering changes, such as the PRISM overhaul.
4. The Space Between cannot directly affect external universes.

Although the Space Between operates independently of other narratives, it still retains unique connections to each of then. It's the "Space Between", not the "White Hallway".

Hawthorne Kalbraxas's consciousness is currently stored in Space Between. In this dimension, Hawthorne is no longer a Seer, but an Observer; in Homestuck terms, a Muse of Void. (The total memetic collapse of her storyline was also avoided in this manner.)

Hawthorne's presence lends a number of "easter eggs" to the PRISM narrative. For example, Ariadne's AI to transcribe the SEE\*R livestream is one of Hawthorne's many facets. Alternatively, Esther's powers of Omnivision can be seen as a parallel to Hawthorne's Observation powers.
