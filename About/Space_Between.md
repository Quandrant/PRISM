## The Space Between

The Space Between is a micronarrative/micro-work independent of d.bot and PRISM. Some ground rules:

1. The Space Between cannot be accessed easily. It must be temporarily "visited".
2. The Space Between is not subject to narrative overhauls, like the SEER-to-PRISM overhaul.
3. The Space Between cannot directly control or modify other narratives.
4. Ex-Avatar Hawthorne is the only inhabitant of the Space Between.
5. The Space Between only has a blue sky, a wheat field, one cloud, and Ex-Avatar Hawthorne.
6. The Space Between is an isolated, closed, superdiegetic system.

Tentative connections between PRISM and the Space Between can be made but they are not necessarily true. You could interpret hobbyist!Ariadne's AI transcription as a facet of Hawthorne, or Esther's (Yellow's) powers of Omnivision as a derivative of Hawthorne's insight into other narratives. I think these are interesting but not very canonical. The Space Between is still an independent work and we can see it's independence by the way it manifests in PRISM today.
