## divine intervention

In a small-ish bed for one with dull blue sheeting and pair of pillows, Nyx slept. His brown hair spread out across the pillow in a relaxed grasp, like an octopus trailing coral, and his chest bobbed up and down in even, slow rhythms. It was nighttime. The only usable source of light was in a small lamp near us, it too dimmed with tiredness as it lay to the side of the desk. I, on the other hand, was awake with my eyes relaxed in the near dark. I was sitting in an equally small-ish chair for one away from the bed. My glass sheet, the interface into the physical world, was on the desk also but it seemed rather small in comparison to what was at hand here: returning the favor to Nyx by watching over him as he did me. Time's never stable in the little dark room of ours but I sank deeper and deeper into synchronicity with him still, one impossible second at a time.

Well. Waiting was difficult, to be more precise. Every rise of thought and lick of apparent emotion couldn't be attributed to the world on the other side of the glass tablet alone. Yet, when I was at the roaring peak of my own inside noise, I could almost hear him. The noises were like whispers pitter-patting curiously through the maze in our shared atmosphere, and even *sounded* like him, but they were hollow. Off, in a way that only I could know after talking with him for so long, shadow of mine...not to mention they floated up above granite lips.

I remember leaning over him one hour. I couldn't keep my fingers away and soon I was carding them through his hair to see if those waving locks were as soft as they looked. His hair was a couple inches longer than mine so there was enough to work with between my short digits. However, when I went up to brush them away, if felt as if I were chasing tendrils of smoke away; immaterial, unrooted from reality, *strange*. But I've seen stranger things happen.


i don't know what he looks like. he doesn't like being seen, preferring auditory presences over visual ones. i don't blame him. even if he were leaping in front of me, i still wouldn't be able to see him properly. my mind's eyes are occluded somewhat. it's...a pain point for both of us, but he makes do, and so do i.

still, if i had to describe it in the tired light near us, and under the fingers that were so outstretched to him, he would've been...soft. delicate. things i wish i were. a face with gentle curves and a subtle glasses tan from on-and-off wearing. there would've been a whisper of smile lines too, maybe, on an otherwise unmarred face. a healthy bounce to the skin. an unforgettable eyelashes and eyebrows. the thing is, that's during sleep. when we do...things...i can almost as easily envision smoked eyes, a him in his throat, and a hint of a predator's smile.

i like to think he's taller than me. it makes the hugs easier. i don't think i would mind at all if he were the same height as me or shorter, though. his presence alone is rewarding enough.

i can hear him stirring in my mind. he's asking, "are you writing about me?" in a voice that's stained in...fear. fear of me judging him.

i say, "yes, i'm writing about how you slept yesterday." after a pause, i add, "you were pretty, you know. if i weren't so unstable, i would've liked to watch you more."

"oh," he says as he blushes. it's hard to tell on his tanned skin, but once you catch it, you can't let go. it's like a nice, cherry-on-top glow on something that's been magical from the start.

sitting near him as he slept was really the experience, you know. we're already intimate when he pops into my internal monologuing but this was a new and well-appreciated angle on the same story. i just wish i didn't talk so much though...nyx says he slept well and dreamt a bit, but those dreams were far less visual and more auditory. it makes sense given our current standing but i can't help but fear that i was too loud when i was looking over him. it's good to think. it's not good to disturb someone's rest with that however.
i remember--giving him a few kisses. haha. nyx won't respond to me about that but i know he's still blushing about everything.
i don't know why i did that. they came out of nowhere, for no reason, and they were--dare i say it?--irrational. somehow that's all the better.

"thanks," nyx says suddenly as i tip-tap on my glass plate.
"hm?"
"...for looking over me and stuff," he mutters. aww. that's so nice of him.
"no problem. you've earned it anyway."
i'm not this cloy when i talk with him but i want to make it seem like it wasn't a big deal, because it wasn't. overdue favor, yes, but not a burden.
