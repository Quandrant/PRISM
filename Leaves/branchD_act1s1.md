## Act 1, Scene 1

_Thunder, lightning, or rain over trees. Enter BETTY BERGERON from the left, eyes closed, pacing._

BETTY
Of the course of the wind, of the rise of the tides, of the seconds to eternity.

_BETTY BERGERON opens her eyes with a start. She is an elderly lady, heading on 78 years old. She has not taken her daily--or nightly, for that matter--medicines to help her remember._

BETTY
Oh my goodness--where am I?
A forest? Is this a dream? But this leaf feels so tender
and the dirt is damp in the fog.

_The WIND blows above her, carrying a message._

WIND
Follow the path,
before (gr)ass's wrath.

BETTY
I best be going now.
The wind whispers foul things to me, here
and the moonlight weakens in the aqua-eiyre.

_The moon wanes and fades, then comes back in the span of a few seconds._

BETTY
The light is oh so fickle! But even
a candle cannot save me from the dark.
"Wands out and ready," they say at the academy.

WIND
Follow the path,
before Magellan Magrath.

BETTY
And yet I am uncertain this Magrath even lies in the branches.
Where are? Come out of the shadows, now. Or I
will blast the sun into the trees and blind your eye.

_BETTY flicks her wand a bit, then a bright ball of light illuminates the area in front of her. She quickly walks from the left side of the stage, where she has been pacing, and exits to the right._

_The curtains fall._
