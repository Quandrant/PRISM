### Brief FAQ's Re: The SEE\*R Program

_What is the SEE\*R Project?_

The SEE\*R Project, otherwise known as "Systematic Euclidean Entering of Realms", is a project to look into neighboring universes alongside ours. It is in a very early alpha stage, so there are bugs around and about, but the main point concern is stability. Unlike the (now defunct) darren.bot protocol, SEE\*R operates under a completely stable viewpoint environment with no mirror bleeding\* and thus far has achieved leaps and bounds more activity than the protocol it replaced. 

_How do I use the SEE\*R program?_

The SEE\*R program is quite easy to use once you get past the heart attack that is room-sized, convoluted program itself. There is a printer, the computing racks of machine itself--proudly splayed about the walls of the project room--and most importantly, an input device. This input device is called the Cordova Terminal, a dedicated and [sic] agent between the user and the machine relaying information between both parties. It was discovered in it's basic form and quickly refurbished and re-purposed by our junior researcher, Ariadne Cordova, for the purposes of this project. 

To use the machine itself, simply turn on all three power of the three different components of the SEE*R) and wait patiently for it to boot. (The three separate switches make it easier to debug the program.) Once it has finished booting, you will see the terminal say "Welcome to the SEE*R. Please input your security credentials as per protocol." Protocol demands you put in your username first, then your password, then any additional authentication depending on your access level. Level 0 users of the program like yourself do not need any additional authentication other than the login credentials, but Level 5 may need a complex multifactor conceptual key just to get through to the basic utilities.

Once you are logged in, you can do many computer-y tasks. The SEE*R has rudimentary computer functions such as mathematical and linguistic computation, programming, and Internet access. However, you may wish to instead look into other universes, called sessions. To do this, type "begin" with nothing else and press the Enter key. The SEE*R will give you the customary precautions if you have not already received them, and allow access into the session.

What you do in the session is up to you, but be warned that you are quite literally looking into another universe, so there are some basic ground rules to prevent anything from going wrong. Anyone who breaks these hard-set rules are subject to the punishment of the local research lab itself and not the local authorities. We wish to remain civil with our neighboring universes no matter how fantastical or bizarre they may be.

_Anything else ?_

Most importantly, we hope you have an excellent trip through the SEE*R program. Thank you for your cooperation.

I still have no idea what mirror bleeding is, nor do I know why I put a space between "e" and "?" in the final FAQ. I'm trusting my past self that it's not a typo.
