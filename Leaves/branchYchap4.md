## Branch Y [Chapter 4]

### **Intermission**

Ariadne paces around the room, deep in musing. There's a problem with the SEE\*R--or rather, a live feed of one of the interpretations of SEE\*R.

Did you think Ariadne is a prisoner of the SEE\*R narrative too? Oh, don't worry, there's no blame done. It's just so easy to think characters are like puppets of the author. After all, that's the general "theme" of the entirety of narrative; you capture a universe and invade the characters, the worm you are, the worm the author is, the worm, the worm. It wriggles.

Anyway, the live feeds stopped. It seems there's nothing more to write or talk about. But that's not really right. Ariadne turns her head to look at the paper print feed. "Still churning away," she notes. Ariadne isn't supposed to talk in the SEE\*R's Project Room but with everyone on vacation she can afford a few spare words here and there.

The room is dimly lit save for the glowing monitors and diodes. The Cordova Terminal almost seems to smile at her, words scrolling up and down and all over the small place of the screen far too fast for her to read anymore. That's what the printer is for, readability, but still...there was a time where she could sit down and read through the nonfiction ["prose" would be so much better here] of another universe. Where that universe was in relation to hers didn't matter so much so that it was _another universe_ out there.

There was a time where she used to be so excited about the prospect of other universes, even before the excitement settled in her skin. She was a junior researcher. There hasn't been much change since then but the story is still the same. What's the point of another universe when it's impossible to physically reach?

Normally the live feeds would come back up by now--they have their fair share of pauses and skips, after all--but Ariadne hasn't had a month-long pause before. Has she? She's only 24, she can't have memory issues now. So why is it so hard for her to concentrate?

She lifts her hand up to examine it in the shallow light of the room, but finds that she's unnaturally weak now. She's so weak she can't lift up her hand to just take a look at it. Where are her glasses? Angrily, she brings her other hand over to swing the suddenly weak hand up into her vision. Reading the lines and crevices, she pales. It is ironic, then, that she oversees a universe where control is given to the characters but she herself does not have that privilege.

Both her arms are weak now. Quickly she dashes to the pitiful monitors. Face flushed with alarm, she swings her shoulders and lets her heavy hands change the channel of the live feed. She didn't want to do this but it seems that there are other memeplexes out to get her again. Terrible, terrifying collections of memes that serve no purpose but to destroy.

Ariadne swings her arms down in a final gesture of defiance and successfully switches the live feed to something else. That's the thing about this stupid, stupid website. There's a live feed of everything. 

Including her own life story.

She scans the words. These words. The ones controlling her every move. Her eyelids droop and fatigue sets in. When was the last time she slept that was anywhere but this accursed research lab? When was the last time she lit up the sun? She wants to turn away so badly, but the more she stares, the more she feels herself regain control.

She focuses on that last word. "Control". In the murky isles of her mind, the word lights up the scene in a brilliant glaze of white. She drags control over to her, across great expanses of the noosphere, and dives head first into it.

When she wakes up, her live feed stopped.

She clutches the remote control in her hand and switches over to the other channels. They're running again. Picking herself up, she flips a few switches on the SEE\*R and lets the narrative unfold yet again.

_Endnotes_

I'm really tempted to have post-PRISM Ariadne go the far-off SEE\*R Laboratory at the end of it all and stumble across the echo of pre-PRISM Ariadne. God, it would be such a great parallel to Betty and Hawthorne's meet in the Space Between. It probably won't be long enough for them to change the future beyond my control, but Ariadne would realize something important. Something really, really important about the struggle of life.
