## Final Avatar: An TLA/LOK Fanfiction

The year is AG 390. Avatar Korra is long dead and the book she's written has since been "uploaded" to Raava, the light spirit. The world has since surpassed the (effective) 1950's and is heading onto the equivalent 2400's. As technology has matched the rapid progression of the years, bending is but an archaic art as more and more of the material world solidifies around them. Yet the world still holds it's breath for the new Avatar, a struggling firebending student by the name [name here].

Technological advancements: the singularity, technological immortality, cloning, limited revival. The life expectancy of the average human is over 150 years at this point, even for firebenders (who, like their element, burn quickly).

Even in Korra's time, the world saw less need for the Avatar. You can imagine in this brave new world that there is no need for the Avatar at all. This "bridge" between the spirit and mortal worlds is just as archaic as the art of bending itself. Trips to the spirit world are common and can even be experienced remotely through the use of VR. Human-fascimile robots with cameras, microphones, touch-receptive sensors offer a safe gateway into...well, nothing. There was a multicolored sky and multicolored ground but not much else. I believe that the Spirit World is in part subjective. The consciousness of the human influences their surroundings a bit, but not as much as the native spirits. After this discovery, people suddenly lost interest in the ethereal landscape and constructed their own Spirit World, complete with an afterlife...sort of.

So the firebender matures and contacts Raava for help. Raava repeats ad nauseum the various, seemingly-copied-and-pasted excerpts from the book. It's only until he has a meltdown that Raava manages to break out of this spell and guide the Avatar through the abandoned Spirit World. They see all sorts of things. It's magical. Forests gleam, the sky is fresh, and things are like a dream. But something's different, and he can't place why.

"Everyone told me that the Spirit World was just...a placeholder."

"The mechanical humans you used to usher into the realm do not have the same mind as flesh humans do.

He glances around. "Something's different, though."

"Yes." Raava pauses, as if she were searching through the Book again. "The human world has influenced the spirit world tremendously. But it seems it's gone one way only."

And then, the Spirit World "opens", as if thick curtains were swept away in a flash. Previously unstable flora are rendered in vivid texture and color, and native spirits take on more pronounced forms than they were before. Raava, however, dulls for a moment
