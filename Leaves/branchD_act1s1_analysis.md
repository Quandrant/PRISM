## Act 1, Scene 1 Analysis

Welcome to class--pay attention!

This analysis will take a purely real-world view to the play with otherwise no connection to it's universe, plot, or characters.

The play opens with a quick, but very important, start that sets the track and pace for the rest of the story. An elderly lady named Betty Bergeron stumbles into a dreamy forest and awakens in its' midst confused. It is late at night, the wind is howling obscenities, and the forest sways with the pouring rain. After musing with a seeming hallucination of the wind, she quickly steps through the forest and exits at the end of the scene.

_[Thunder, lightning, **or** rain over trees. Enter BETTY BERGERON from the left, eyes closed.]_

Right off the bat there is an allusion to Shakespeare, but in a very curious location: the stage directions. Yes, the author is writing this play for a stage, why wouldn't they be? Regardless of the stage vs. cinema debate, the author makes a clear reference to the opening scene of Macbeth. "Thunder, lightning, or rain over trees." Could it simply be grasping at straws? Let's see.

_[FIRST WITCH: When shall we three meet again / In thunder, lightning, or in rain?]_

It's also curious that the stage directions have "or" in place of "and". Thunder, lightning, or rain? It most certainly narrows things down for the stage crew, but the incompletion of the setting lends the scene a very subtle feeling of loss. Thunder gives the audience security away from the moisture and lights; lightning dazzles the eyes but dries up the sensations of touch and sound; rain drenches the setting with very little to offer the eyes or ears.

_[BETTY: Of the course of the wind, of the rise of the tides, of the seconds to eternity.]_

It should be noted that the author has a number of motifs in his various works. All authors do, really. In this quote, the author touches on the topics of the wind, the tides, and eternity. Cross-checking with other of the author's works or personal journals reveals a striking pattern of discussions on celestial phenomena; such motifs include the stars, the night, the city, fire, light, darkness, void, and other things.

The three natural phenomena discussed in Betty's very first line of the screenplay could not be any more obvious. The course of the wind? The rising of tides? The seconds to eternity--oh, wait. That's another reference. It points to the tale of "The Shepherd Boy" by the Brothers Grimm. A king asks the very clever shepherd boy how many seconds there are in eternity. The shepherd boy gives an answer along the lines of "it's uncountable, any way to describe it will invariably boggle the mind".

_[SHEPHERD BOY: Every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it (the great diamond mountain), and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.]_

As for the line itself...it doesn't exist. At least not in the prime work of the SEE*R Project. The addition of a detached Betty Bergeron is entirely original to the screenplay, but admittedly does give it some flair. Wind, tides, eternity. Natural phenomena, and the messages behind it. Quite fascinating.

So after a brief bout of detached sleeptalking, Betty opens her eyes.

_[She has not taken her daily--or nightly, for that matter--medicines to help her remember.]_

Why would Betty need "medicines to help her remember"? Shouldn't it just be a single pill? Or even no pill at all? Cross-checking with the other branches reveals that the world where everything takes place is something of a utopia. Ageless, near-immortal people with little to worry about than their current job, a secure environment, a constantly booming economy, perhaps even planetary colonization.

The problem, then, is that every one of these advancements came after Betty's prime time. The cure to aging requires a genetic lock, the secure environments require money, the booming economy is hostile to older generations, and planetary colonization is taxing on the body. Betty has none of that. She's old as grass with a body to match,

I didn't complete this analysis, unfortunately, but it's interesting in that it's the most "real-world" or "sane" of anything in the previously-known SEE\*R Project. It's written like a real-world report on the author, the story, and the allusions of that writing. That kind of realism is pretty whimsical (at least, pre-PRISM) because it's a tangible anchor. The SEE\*R Project is so abstract and free-floating that it tries to compensate by attempting to root itself in this current reality, yet it arrives just out of reach. This anchor helps that, even if it's just an analysis.
