## Branch Y [Chapter 5]

When Hawthorne Kalbraxas opened her eyes again, she stood in a yellowing wheat field.

Must be Kansas, she thought. It's a strange, strange thought. Almost too human.

Though there was no air to be found around her, she still breathed and watched the plants in their colorful stasis swing gently. She brushed a hand through the little ocean of gold and observed as the small ripple that followed was swallowed up in the larger sway of things. The edges of her dress swayed with the field and her mind slowed to a calm trickle.

She reached her hands up and tried to find her eyes. It seems the space where her eyes once were are now occupied by thin pools of radiant, but ghostly, white. The light behaved like water as it sloshed around to the movement of her head. If she weren't feeling so misaligned right now she would feel quite startled by this new development, maybe stumble back and fall right onto her ass. In the dead grass.

Grass?

She shook her head, trying to clear her bustling...thoughts? They're so far away. They didn't feel much like thoughts; they were more akin to mischievous words on the wind. The space all around her felt like a dream, but that sensation of touch earlier felt so...real. Not even her personal apocalypse back home could be as vivid as this. It doesn't matter. She refocuses on the unearthly land around her, on the grass that's come up in place of the wheat all before. A plant cannot change it's form in such an instant. She could have been hallucinating everything in this surreal space, but if she wasn't, at least she knew that the wheat to grass switch was a serious violation of physics.

Violation of physics, eh?

Hawthorne turned around, searching for the voice. "Where are you? Show yourself!"

It is ironic then, that such a renowned and powerful Seer has been reduced to a blind, shambling fool.

The voice was grating and terrible, and almost certainly mocking. She could almost see the disdain on the speaker's face as they saw her, but she could not see them. "I'm not blind." Her eyesockets smoked and the gray wisps billowed, waved in front of her face. She blew it away. Of course she can see. Of course she's not blind. She's Hawthorne Kalbraxas, the greatest Seer to ever walk the earth.

Except there is no Earth.

She turned around once again, gritting her teeth. "Of course there is Earth, I'm standing on it right now! Come out and fight me, foolish cynic." Hawthorne reached back for her needles, but found nothing. Okay. Well, she's been in worse.

Is she standing on the vibrant planet? Or is she actually trapped in a space between two universes, where all the natural laws of the world she once lived in no longer apply?

She went into a coma, sure, but it might have...she growls. She completes the thought. It might have thrown her across dimensions. Stuff like that happens. It happened to her friends when they tried to contact other timelines, other--realities. They dragged her friends through boundary of her universe, and now they remain in a state between existence and nonexistence, and relevance and obscurity.

The speaker suddenly became silent, so silent that it wouldn't be far-fetched to say they finally left Hawthorne alone.

And there was a chance they could be right there in front of her but she couldn't see them. As frustrating as the consequences of such a possibility may be, the thought made her feel as light as a balloon. Her mind suddenly seemed to be as if it were resting on hope. The rare kind that gives color to life. She hadn't talked to her estranged friends in so very long. Immortality does that to people sometimes. The want became a need, and soon her mind was in razor sharp focus again. Eagerly, Hawthorne turned her face up and started running for the horizon.

_Endnotes_

This was something I never thought I would write. Essentially, this chapter serves as the only bridge between the end of darren.bot and the start of pre-PRISM SEE\*R.

At the very end of darren.bot, Hawthorne Kalbraxas (the avatar of the session) succumbs to the Black Spot in her mind. She was the final human alive on Earth after the apocalypse. When she wakes up again, she's transported into a space between universe. The _original_ Space Between.

This actually is a reference to a very old writing project, a Homestuck AU digging into the mechanics of SBURB. It was called Infinity Mechanism. To survive the scratch, two of the session players chose not to cross Paradox Space. Instead, they ripped a hole between stories called "The Space Between" and crossed there to the other session.

Every "Space Between" is the same. The one Hawthorne arrived at took on the form of a wheat field because it was a clear reflection of her mind.
