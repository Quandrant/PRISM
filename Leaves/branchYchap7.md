## Branch Y [Chapter 7]

\> **bootstrap**

Which is why it's so strange that her city, and the surrounding areas, remains ever so crisp throughout the days. A mild balance only shifted degrees of Kelvin in sync to the movement of the moon, up and down, up and down, push and pull~~, like loving a fool~~.

\> **is there anything done to counter this bizarre climate locking?**

A branch snaps underneath her bare foot, but Betty continues walking. She wonders why, just why, there hasn't been anything done to quell the screeching of flaming harpies to the north or accentuate the whispers of the frozen. The news outlets all work and the media still prints. What keeps their mouth shut?

She could investigate the conspiracy, if she really wanted to. Pose the disguise of a helpless old lady wandering the government archive, then snatch yellowed documents right under their tight, pinched noses.

Unfortunately, paper has been outlawed for many decades now. Archives on hard drives, then archives on disks, then archives on f\*\*king tape. Each stored in their respective levels of containment...and cyber-security has always been the government's forte ever since she was a little girl. (Which is to say a very, very long time.) There are a great many things that quantum computers can solve, and perhaps even break, but the government's secrecy is not one of them. If anyone has broken their security, they would have done it by now. A widespread pandemic taking a whole year to solve. An eternity in the eyes of the public.

It probably would be easier and more viable to physically steal a briefcase full of tape cassettes than it is to take folders and folders of masticated wood. (Do people still use handheld containers anymore now that everyone runs on cache?) The information is all the more dense on tape than it is on a few hundred sheaves of paper, she supposes. And people venture down to the bottom of the ocean all the time without knowing it's one of the locations of the archives. Exoskeletons have become so durable and cheap that there are rumors space agencies all around the world simply stack three of them together and send courageous astronauts off to the rings of Saturn.

Betty laughs a little. It seems the rebellious, curious part of her never truly left. It's a surprise to see it come back while walking under a sad little moon and between curled branches and dusty soil. Maybe it'll help her live out the rest of her days in adventure. For the first time in a long time, she feels...alright.

The moon flicks off for the cycle. The people up there must be very busy if they're harvesting that much energy from the Sun.

\> **inspect the lower tier magical wand.**

Betty is not of the Seer class and cannot use the highly unique class ability of inspection. (The word "render" may be the suitable substitute.)

Calling it lower tier is, by all means, a compliment. It's highly basic

_Endnotes_

This is the final chapter of the Branch Y rewrite of the canon. It's really abrupt, but again, it was highly experimental. There's another chapter technically, but I don't really consider it one.
