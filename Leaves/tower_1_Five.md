## The Tower [CONTAINS MENTION OF THE FIVE, OF WHICH IS NOW REMOVED IN THE CURRENT RELEASE]

Betty Bergeron stands at the foot of the pastel island. Pale foam laps at the pink sand as she rises out of her boat in rubber boots. The air is cool and dry. Meanwhile, the sun hangs before the horizon wondering if it should dip down slowly or duck in a long swipe. It's a tough decision for the flaming ball of gas, but physics demands decisons, and the earth makes it's move before the sun does. Betty stomps around the island a bit, but it's only until a few minutes has passed that her eyes begin to trail up the spiralling tower.

"Ladon is up there," she says in dismay.

It's honestly ridiculous how he was captured so easily. After all the adventures they've had together, Ladon should have known better than to unsuccessfully wrangle with the Five. *Alone*. Most of Ladon and Betty's encounters with them tend to end in narrowly-accomplished escapes. Still, however, she'll have to send in a complaint ticket to the Five so as to let Ladon struggle a bit before they inevitably take him somewhere. Not that a collective mess of memetic horrors brought to life would care much for a complaint ticket anyhow, but still.

Tired from the trip, Betty plops down onto the sand and turns to face the setting sun. The memory of the tower falls away as the sight of the rose sand and milky white water floods her eyes. It's not a very good sunset. Rather than the multicolored spectacle back at her apartment she's grown to love, there's only a gradient from blue to darker blue here with a string of white dots...except it's not dark enough to see the stars yet.

Raising her head again, she focuses on the trail of white above. It's hard to tell exactly, but it looks to be a constant stream of paper airplanes flying from the very top of the icy tower. They sail away from the thick ice, over her dilapidated boat, and far away to the horizon. (Hopefuly they don't burn up in the sun. Poor Ladon.) Curiously, there's no physical hand giving the fragile items lift--they're even struggling in the absence of one. It sure would be nice to give those paper planes some help. Betty lifts her left palm up to the trail of paper planes, closes her eyes, and imagines herself throwing them. Almost immediately, they pick up speed. Some veer off course. She hasn't thrown a paper plane for a very long time.

It takes a while for one of these stubborn planes to come to her, but one arrives anyway. It falls into Betty's still open hand. She opens it with barely-hushed anticipation. As she scans the page she notices a few things, like Ladon's blocky handwriting and the incomprehensible text.

"Nyx still needs to tell Lux about the faded constellations. It's hard to tell how we can move on from here. Ask M.Q."

The short letter is signed off with the name "Orange". She's never heard of anyone named Orange in her life. Maybe Ladon has been here long enough that he's forgotten who he is and chose a new name? It's a childish thought, but Betty still suppresses a nervous shiver.

The sun falls swiftly and the nighttime rises to take it's place. It's getting really late. Quickly, she packs her items up and rushes into the brittle tower.
