## Branch Y [Chapter 3]

She stands in the dark forest, eyes snapped open and head tilted upward. Her breathing wavers a bit, due to her age, but she reestablishes airflow in the midst of the sudden change in scenery. The stars glitter high and wild through the branches of the trees, soft pings from light-years away cresting over her head and down her back.

\> **provide additional context.**

Betty Bergeron is not a name given to her, but one that she chose for herself. Bony hands, wide eyes, and a wrinkled face from the wear and tear of the ages identifies her existence amongst the generic hordes of the eternally young.

She digs around in her small cache, checking simple row of boxes by touch for her wand. A compass, a slab of metal, three dollars...where is it? Frowning, she sticks her hand farther left, and feels the tell-tale snap of plastic leaping into her hand. She pulls it out, seemingly out of thin air, and says "I wish for light in this obscure, dark forest." She would be embarrassed to use a snap spell for light, but she can't remember the correct word for "illumination". Lumox? Lumis? Lux? She should have taken one of those 24 hour memetic pills in case of crazy sleepwalking journeys like this one. 

It doesn't matter now. She moves the tip of the wand further up over her head, wondering where all the insects and insects are. Nocturnal animals are not uncommon in her area. Er, assuming she is in her area still. She can't be more than a mile away from her apartment, but then again, she _has_ found herself breaking the surface of the ocean with a sailboat once. That would have been fun if she knew how to pilot a boat through churning waters. Even more harrowing was the mark on her bank account once she made it back to shore. Now that was harrowing!

She shakes herself out of her reverie and tries very hard to place this astute observation into her mind. No animals at night even though her area should be crawling with them. Okay. How does she mentally peg that into her body? Animals at the top of her scalp, negative at her right shoulder, local area at the elbow. Animals, negative, local area. No animals in the local area. She's missing something. Betty looks up, squinting at the dark sky. Dark sky. There's a word for that. Night! Night at the palm of her hand. Animal head, negative shoulder, local area elbow, nighttime palm. Got it. That took a lot longer than it should have.

She's not sure why she's investigating the nighttime fauna of some weird forest she managed to stumble her way through, but it wouldn't hurt too many people--she snickers quietly--if she basked in the slim moonlight for a few more moments. It's not like she's avoiding her apartment.

\> **start the trek through the forest.**

Such begins the trek through the forest.

She flicks the little ball of light at the top of her wand off of it, and lets it lead the way through the trees. The dirt pathway is moist under her feet with the exception of the dry leaves littered all over the place. A small creek slips and gurgles nearby, but she pays no mind to it since she's too busy catching up with the rapidly speeding ball of light.

Head, shoulder, elbow, palm. It's very disconcerting that there is no animalian life here. Animals are nice. Especially mammals. They're so warm, which of course, is a stark contrast to the bitter cold that seems to leech the heat right out of the air around her. Her heat-leeching and is a bad habit she can't kick, but it doesn't do anyone harm, so she leaves it alone. She treats these personal quirks mildly, choosing instead to tolerate it if it is harmless. The process of editing is simple, as it should be. She shivers, but continues moving. There must be an end to this forest, for there is always an end to all things.

The ball of light dwindles and quickly fades. The dark is closing in on her now, waves of oblivion rising and falling and rising and falling to meet her at the line between sight and blindness and sound and silence. Her mind falls short and the rampant stream of thoughts goes silent. A touch of rationality lighting the way, doused in water and left to smoke itself out idly. Near her left ear a headache coalesces and stings. The scent of smoke is carried over the solemn air. She has diverged from the path. Betty glances downward, then over to the left. There's the path. She follows the moonlight up over the pebbles and dirt of the soft incline, then resumes her brisk pace. The leaves continue to crunch, much as the branches continue to whisper, much as the stars continue to wink, much as the corpse of time itself continues to decay into primordial sludge, much as the air continues to still.

It's hard to get used to this. The sleepwalking, the shake in her hands, the reliance on memory-aiding medicines, the strange dreams, and most of all the caricatured climates. Ever since the meteor hit two and a half weeks ago, climates all over the world have become locked in an intense facsimile of their normal weather patterns.

Some places blaze under the intense heat, making it impossible for farmers to grow crops or herd cattle. Even a day in the hellish climate would dry out the organism until it is nothing but a dead preserve of the thing it was. Everyone else stayed in their homes but with such little water, most of them died of thirst or committed suicide. Only a fool would try to help the chicken burning the oven. They were dead before they started dropping like flies. Meanwhile, other places crack and break in the astringent freeze. Plants and animals would die just as easily as if they were under the angry sun up north, for the water in their bodies would freeze in less than five hours and slice them all up from the inside. For the ones that are luckier further south, the cold would freeze the water immediately and the amorphous ice would trap the structure of their bodies in a permanent stasis of no escape. No one goes there either.

Perpetual life, no matter how diminished it may be, always seems more harrowing than complete death, she concludes.

_Endnotes_

The tone of Branch Y is startlingly light when compared to the post-PRISM main branch, Z. It's like Betty's age has finally caught up with her and she doesn't have much to worry about anymore. It's nice when you think about it.

An interesting point to consider is the mention of Betty somehow sleepwalking onto a sailboat and making her way across the ocean. This event is actually written in the PRISM Branch Z, but it's canonically after she starts her adventure.

Another interesting point is that Betty is...cold. Her body cannot produce heat well, so she practically has to leech the ambient energy off of other things.
