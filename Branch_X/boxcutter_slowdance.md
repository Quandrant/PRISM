## Boxcutter Slowdance

"Boxcutter Slowdance" is a proposed name for the new arc of PRISM. In this arc, colors start to disappear in Betty's town and she needs to figure out what's up with the entire situation. The difficulty comes in the seemingly-subjective nature of the issue, since Betty is one of the few people that can perceive the missing colors. I'm thinking that everyone else 

1. has tricked themselves into continuing to see color, as if they were in a perpetual optical illusion.
2. adapted to the progressive color drain.

[The name "Boxcutter Slowdance" comes from the cherub species-swap Archive of Our Own fanfiction of the same name](https://archiveofourown.org/works/478081). Much in the same way, I've swapped the concept of the Five being powerful reality-altering memes into  physical representations of color. Even though the Five don't exist anymore, that doesn't mean I can't have a group causing trouble for Betty in at least one arc.

Here are the colors and their characteristics:

1. Red/Eros: vibrant, spontaneous, active, passionate, bold, wild, easily bored, antagonistic, most evil. Sparks murders of passion. Everywhere. Formidable telekinetic powers.
2. Orange/Ladon: complex, subtle, lonely, misguided, least likely to help Betty. Attracted to Ladon. Grants wishes, and then twists them -- monkey's paw
3. Yellow/Esther: mysterious, pensive, abstract, perceptive, slow, memetic, deals with the past and future, possibilities, interested in details. Gives and takes away vision, sight, awareness, fortune.
4. Green/Ariadne: illuminative, curious, investigative, rational, lost, ephemeral, benevolent-neutral. The living dream of Ariadne, a universe away. Has truly formidable time powers.
5. Blue/Kain: cold, tired, melancholy, concrete, lives in the present, neutral, looks for the big picture, most likely to help Betty. Innately all-seeing through the present
6. Purple/Mariqnne: crazy, obsessive, powerful, sardonic, insecure, tenacious, ruthless, calculating. Specializes in bad luck.
7. Black/Nyx: echoing, void-heavy, immaterial, embodies disorder, works with White
8. White/Lux: carefully composed, transparent, "beyond" color, lucid, wary, accepting of Black

At some point in the arc, Ladon makes a deal with Orange in an attempt to help solve the color issue. Unfortunately, making a deal with one of the entities that's involved in the problem in the first place is asking for trouble. Ladon winds up containing Orange by sacrifice, and unwittingly sways his allegiance.

Betty makes a similar deal with Blue as she scours her town for the other misbehaving colors. However, Betty's contract is much cleaner and more precise than Ladon's head-first plunge. Notably, Blue is "contained" within an amulet that Betty wears on her neck at all times.

In A1, Ariadne has some Color problems too. [When she goes to sleep, she literally dreams of being Green in Universe B3.](https://discord.com/channels/514174340166844426/711386562864087050/715796183926439977) Green is the living dream of Ariadne, and often absent from the Color's workings for this reason.

### Plot?

1. Betty wakes up and notices that things are "off" somehow.
2. Betty tries telling people around her town about this, they brush her off, she meets Ladon for a quick chat, he notices it too.
3. Betty starts to gain intel on the situation ("If things look cooler, then that must mean a warmer color is weakening"), realizes the color yellow is desaturating.
4. Betty ventures out of her town to see if this anomaly is affecting the rest of the world; it's not, it's just her town.
5. Betty comes back, the entire color of yellow is gone; she asks the public again, they brush her off, Ladon comes to her in panic.
6. A new visitor arrives at the town--a specific part of their appearance is stark yellow, a color haven't been seen for 2 weeks. Her name is Esther.
     1. "They must be tied to the color weirdness somehow," Betty says conspiratorially.
7. More colors disappear and more people come through the town; Betty and Ladon go full CIA and start keeping tabs on them.
     1. "Yup, just as I thought. None of these people actually exist. It's like they...popped into existence yesterday."
     2. She suppresses a chill. "They might as well have."
8. Ladon decides to take matters into his own hands and go after Orange. It...doesn't go well.
     1. Ladon casts a rough spell. Orange takes the chance to manipulate the deal slightly. Instead of imprisoning just Orange at the island, he also imprisons himself.
9. Betty's investigation into the Colors slows and she decides to look for Ladon, but it seems he's disappeared somehow.
     1. At the island, Ladon and Orange begin to live together. They are very distrusting of each other.
11. In a whirlwind of frustration and confusion, Betty wrecks her home.
12. Betty seeks aid in the recent dissipating color: Blue.
13. On the island, Orange has been splintering their timeline. This will become a problem, later. In the meantime, they get to know each other better -- and contact other people.
     1. Crucial plot points: Ladon threatening Orange, Ladon making a wish to sleep with Orange, Orange depowering in the ocean, Ladon's talks to Ariadne, Orange admitting acts of service, Ladon reciprocating, Ladon being the vessel for Nyx, Green talking to Orange and Ladon.
14. Blue fills in Betty with some information on the Colors and what they do: become new gods, raise White. Ladon is still a priority; Blue then helps Betty to open her third eye and see through the dense magical shield around Ladon and Orange's island.
     1. Betty realizes that Ladon is at the lighthouse, a long-forgotten structure near the coast of her town.
     2. Betty and Blue plan their next moves, and prepare their supplies.
16. Betty and Blue arrive at the island. Ladon meets them at the beach. Orange is suspiciously absent. Betty is angry and very concerned. Ladon reassures he's fine. They begin to leave.
17. However, the moment Ladon steps foot off the island, all of the other timelines cascade into him. He goes unconscious. Orange materializes in a crack of lightning next to Ladon, gripping his head. Betty neutralizes and interrogates Orange as to what has happened. They realize Ladon is remembering all of the other timelines. They all leave the island.
17. At home, Ladon wakes up, but he is feral, unstable, and with metamorphasis problems. The alternate memories impair his cognitive functioning. Betty works around the clock taking care of Ladon.
18. Blue drops another fact bomb: in addition to this cognitive impairment, Ladon has harbored bits of various colors in him over the lifetimes. Orange's influence was keeping them at bay, and Ladon has a strange assortment of new powers.
19. Betty still does not trust Blue entirely, and she sure as hell dislikes Orange. Betty makes the clever decision to keep them both in proximity to each other, neutralizing both of them through inversion sickness. She comissions them to take care of Ladon as she continues the journey.
     1. Blue is still able to contact Betty through the amulet, however.
20. Betty finds Ariadne seemingly sleepwalking through the town. Green fills Betty in on everything. Although she cannot help Betty as Blue can, she vows to avoid conflict with Betty until the issue is solved.
21. The other Colors (Red, Yellow, Purple) are found but they seem to be in communication with each other now. Purple takes Orange's position as the head of the group and decides they need to grow stronger. They start to expand past the town borders, sucking the color out of the nearby terrain.
22. Betty, in another show of might, traps everyone in the town with a powerful spell and contains the antagonistic Colors' reach. However, she is seriously drained.
23. Plans change and the Colors decide that if they can't get outside resources, they need to make the most of their existing ones by coming together into White. They broadcast this outcome to the other Colors.
     1. Orange confirms the broadcast. Blue relays this information to Betty.
24. Meanwhile, Ladon has been getting better, but he is still not entirely lucid. Orange and Blue have been talking about Ladon, and the future when they are absorbed into Lux. Orange reveals Ladon's internal color signature looks remarkably similar to Nyx, but he wasn't sure what it meant. Blue realizes Ladon is the vessel for Nyx, and can defeat Lux. They plan to summon Nyx. Orange is the key; Ladon is the gate; Blue is the one to pull the doors open. They also relay this information to Betty.
25. Final battle:
     1. Betty stands at the tallest building in the black and white town, armed to the teeth with weapons. She is prepared to die.
     2. White/Lux incarnates. Blue vanishes from Betty's amulet, and Orange dissolves into the wind. Ariadne suddenly stops dreaming in green, and she drives straight to SEER to watch what's happening.
     3. Lux begins to pull the color white out of the gray scene, leaving darkness and sketched lines everywhere.
     4. Nyx is summoned Ladon wakes up and tugs at the darkness around him, growing to a size similar to Lux. The town of Calinas is wireframes and simple shapes.
     5. IDK how to write the final battle. It could be a mutual destruction, splintering Ladon and the other Colors. Not sure what to do with the other Colors. I do want Ladon and Orange to stay nearby each other though. And Blue could reverse Betty's magical impairment, too
