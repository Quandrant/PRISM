## Boxcutter Slowdance

"Boxcutter Slowdance" is a proposed name for the new arc of PRISM. In this arc, the world is bleached of color one at a time and Betty has to solve that...somehow. The difficulty in the quest comes in the hidden nature of the entire situation, since she is one of the few people that can truly perceive the colorless world. I'm thinking that everyone else 

1. has tricked themselves into continuing to see color, as if they were in a perpetual optical illusion.
2. accepted the grayness the moment it came, adapting to a change mildly.

I was thinking of making the story noir-style since the scenery is going to be all black and white, but I don't have experience with the genre.

[The name "Boxcutter Slowdance" comes from the cherub species-swap Archive of Our Own fanfiction of the same name](https://archiveofourown.org/works/478081). Much in the same way, I've swapped the concept of the Five being powerful reality-altering memes into  physical representations of color. Even though the Five don't exist anymore, that doesn't mean I can't have a group causing trouble for Betty in at least one arc.

Here are the colors and their characteristics:

1. Red/Eros: vibrant, spontaneous, active, passionate, bold, wild, easily bored
2. Orange/Ladon: complex, subtle, lonely, misguided, least likely to help Betty
3. Yellow/Esther: mysterious, pensive, abstract, perceptive, slow, memetic, deals with the past, interested in details,
4. Green/Ariadne: illuminative, curious, investigative, rational, lost, most akin to Ariadne
5. Blue/Kain: cold, tired, melancholy, concrete, lives in the present, looks for the big picture, most likely to help Betty
6. Purple/Mariqnne: crazy, obsessive, powerful, sardonic, insecure,
7. Black/Nyx: echoing, void-heavy, immaterial, embodies disorder, works with White
8. White/Lux: carefully composed, transparent, "beyond" color, lucid, wary, accepting of Black

At some point in the arc, Ladon makes a deal with Orange in an attempt to help solve the color issue. Unfortunately, making a deal with one of the people that's directly involved in the problem in the first place is just asking for trouble. Whether Ladon is attempting containment by sacrifice or trying to sway Orange's allegiances remains to be seen.

Betty makes a similar deal with Blue as she scours the globe for the other misbehaving colors. However, Betty's contract is much cleaner and more precise than Ladon's head-first plunge. Notably, Blue is "contained" within an amulet that Betty wears on her neck at all times.

Over in Universe A, Ariadne has some Color problems too. [When she goes to sleep, she literally dreams of being Green in Universe B.](https://discord.com/channels/514174340166844426/711386562864087050/715796183926439977) We can theorize with certainty that Ariadne's dreams take place in a one-way, non-SEE\*R, Intersection Point between Universe A and B. Like Ladon's situation, what Ariadne chooses to do with this power remains to be seen.
