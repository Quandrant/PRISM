## Boxcutter Slowdance

"Boxcutter Slowdance" is a proposed name for the new arc of PRISM. In this arc, colors start to disappear in Betty's town and she needs to figure out what's up with the entire situation. The difficulty comes in the seemingly-subjective nature of the issue, since Betty is one of the few people that can perceive the missing colors. I'm thinking that everyone else 

1. has tricked themselves into continuing to see color, as if they were in a perpetual optical illusion.
2. adapted to the progressive color drain.

[The name "Boxcutter Slowdance" comes from the cherub species-swap Archive of Our Own fanfiction of the same name](https://archiveofourown.org/works/478081). Much in the same way, I've swapped the concept of the Five being powerful reality-altering memes into  physical representations of color. Even though the Five don't exist anymore, that doesn't mean I can't have a group causing trouble for Betty in at least one arc.

Here are the colors and their characteristics:

1. Red/Eros: vibrant, spontaneous, active, passionate, bold, wild, easily bored
2. Orange/Ladon: complex, subtle, lonely, misguided, least likely to help Betty
3. Yellow/Esther: mysterious, pensive, abstract, perceptive, slow, memetic, deals with the past, interested in details,
4. Green/Ariadne: illuminative, curious, investigative, rational, lost, most akin to Ariadne
5. Blue/Kain: cold, tired, melancholy, concrete, lives in the present, looks for the big picture, most likely to help Betty
6. Purple/Mariqnne: crazy, obsessive, powerful, sardonic, insecure, tenacious
7. Black/Nyx: echoing, void-heavy, immaterial, embodies disorder, works with White
8. White/Lux: carefully composed, transparent, "beyond" color, lucid, wary, accepting of Black

At some point in the arc, Ladon makes a deal with Orange in an attempt to help solve the color issue. Unfortunately, making a deal with one of the entities that's involved in the problem in the first place is asking for trouble. Whether Ladon is attempting containment by sacrifice or trying to sway Orange's allegiances remains to be seen.

Betty makes a similar deal with Blue as she scours her town for the other misbehaving colors. However, Betty's contract is much cleaner and more precise than Ladon's head-first plunge. Notably, Blue is "contained" within an amulet that Betty wears on her neck at all times.

Over in Universe A, Ariadne has some Color problems too. [When she goes to sleep, she literally dreams of being Green in Universe B.](https://discord.com/channels/514174340166844426/711386562864087050/715796183926439977) We can theorize with certainty that Ariadne's dreams take place in a one-way, non-SEE\*R, Intersection Point between Universe A and B. Like Ladon's situation, what Ariadne chooses to do with this power remains to be seen.

### Plot?

1. Betty wakes up and notices that things are "off" somehow.
2. Betty tries telling people around her town about this, they brush her off, she meets Ladon for a quick chat, he notices it too.
3. Betty starts to gain intel on the situation ("If things look cooler, then that must mean a warmer color is weakening"), realizes the color yellow is desaturating.
4. Betty ventures out of her town to see if this anomaly is affecting the rest of the world; it's not, it's just her town.
5. Betty comes back, the entire color of yellow is gone; she asks the public again, they brush her off, Ladon comes to her in panic.
6. A new visitor arrives at the town--a specific part of their appearance is stark yellow, a color haven't been seen for 2 weeks.
     1. "They must be tied to the color weirdness somehow," Betty says conspiratorially.
7. More colors disappear and more people come through the town; Betty and Ladon go full CIA and start keeping tabs on them.
     1. "Yup, just as I thought. None of these people actually exist. It's like they...popped into existence yesterday."
     2. She suppresses a chill. "They might as well have."
8. Ladon decides to take matters into his own hands and go after Orange. It...doesn't go well.
     1. Ladon, not knowing he has to make a deal with the entity, accidentally allows himself to be abducted to the infamous island under Orange's *own* parameters.
9. Betty's investigation slows and she decides to look for Ladon, but it seems he's disappeared somehow.
10. In a whirlwind of frustration and confusion, Betty wrecks her home.
11. Betty seeks aid in the recent dissipating color: Blue.
12. Blue helps Betty out with the information side, but Ladon is still a priority; Blue then helps Betty to open her third eye and see through the "Veil" (implied to be a weak antimemetic cloud able to be manipulated).
     1. Betty realizes that Ladon is at the lighthouse, a long-forgotten structure near the coast of her town.
13. Betty storms lighthouse, grabs Ladon, and gets out of there before Orange can catch her.
     1. But Orange is everywhere, and like the cloud occluding the lighthouse, he's concentrated in Ladon. An altercation nearly happens but Betty, with the power of Blue, drives Orange into the deepest recesses of Ladon's mind and dormancy.
15. Ladon wakes up but Orange's influence has wrecked his identity; in the absence of Orange, he is uncontrollable and multicolored, with metamorphasis problems to boot.
16. Blue appears of her own accord and drops another factbomb...identity magic or not, Ladon has harbored bits of various colors in him over the lifetimes, and it seems that it was Orange himself that was keeping them at bay.
17. Betty makes the decision to put Ladon under the care of Blue she continues the journey.
     1. Blue is still able to contact Betty through the amulet, however.
18. Betty finds Ariadne, almost sleepwalking through the town. Ariadne is Green, and though she cannot help Betty as Blue can, she vows to avoid conflict with Betty until the issue is solved.
19. The other Colors are found but they seem to be in communication with each other now. Purple takes Orange's position as the head of the group and decides they need to grow stronger, so they start to expand past the town borders.
20. Betty, in another show of might, traps everyone in the town with a powerful spell affecting the antimemetic cloud around them.
21. Plans change and the Colors decide that if they can't get outside resources, they need to make the most of their existing ones by coming together into White.
     1. Blue relays this information to Betty.
22. All the while, Ladon gets worse and worse until he's comatose and interacting with Orange again.
     1. It's revealed that Orange took a genuine liking to Ladon from the start and the two talk about what's happening. Orange says that in a few days, he'll be absorbed into Lux/White, the barrier containing the town will break, and the world will burn under the gaze of a living supernova.
     2. The two walk through Ladon's tattered mind, remarking on how colorful it is when everything in the real world is so gray.
     3. Orange realizes that Lux can be stopped by a complete antithesis in Ladon. Nyx never incarnated because he was already here.
23. Final battle:
     1. Betty stands at the tallest building in the town armed to the teeth with weapons.
     2. White incarnates. Blue vanishes from Betty's amulet and Orange slips away from Ladon.
     3. White begins to pull the color white out of the gray scene, leaving darkness and sketched lines everywhere.
     4. Ladon wakes up and tugs at the darkness around him, growing to a size similar to Lux.
