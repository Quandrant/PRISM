## Boxcutter Slowdance

Boxcutter Slowdance is the proposed name for a  new arc of the PRISM Project. In this arc, Betty goes on a quest after an event that has rendered all of visible reality in shades of gray, or in other words, without color. Interestingly, these colors went rogue after that same event gave them material form. What makes this difficult is tht Betty is one of the few that can actually perceive the gray with her stolen Seer glasses. I'm thinking that everyone else 

1. deluded themselves into continuing to see color.
2. accepted the grayness.
3. actually can't see anything wrong and Betty is the only one who knows because of some other device.

I'm also thinking of making the story noir-style since it's going to be all black and white, but I don't have experience with the genre.

The name "Boxcutter Slowdance" comes from the Archive of Our Own fanfiction of the same name wherein the alpha kids are species swapped into cherubs. In a way, I've swapped the concept of the Five being powerful reality-altering memes into physical represenations of color. Even though the Five don't exist anymore, that doesn't mean I can't have a group causing trouble for Betty in at least one arc.

Here are the colors and their characteristics:

1. Red/Eros: vibrant, spontaneous, passionate, bold, wild, easily bored
2. Orange/Ladon: complex, influencing, misguided, least likely to help Betty
3. Yellow/Esther: mysterious, pensive, abstract, perceptive, slow, likes the past,
4. Green/Ariadne: illuminative, curious, investigative, rational, most akin to Ariadne
5. Blue/Kain: cold, tired, melancholy, concrete, lives in the present, most likely to help Betty
6. Purple/Mariqnne: crazy, obsessive, powerful, sardonic,
7. Black/Nyx:
8. White/Lux: carefully composed, transparent,
