## Teatime (Betty the Muse)

The teacup shook in her hand. Amber liquid rippled along the side of the white, delicately curved walls as Betty Bergeron brought it up to her lips absentmindedly.

Absentminded isn't the correct word here. Betty is actually quite deep in thought, so far down the metaphorical drain of her mind that everything else around her is as immaterial as the detritus in said tornado. What's in the detritus?

This is foolish, Betty thinks with mild anger, I should be enjoying this fine cup of tea. But as she stares out the window, a strange thought crosses the eye of the storm. It comes onto her like a large black spider lunging from wall to wall, descending before her--or in this case, lunging from swirling bits of large debris to wind-swept rubble and back again.
