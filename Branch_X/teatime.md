## Teatime (Betty the Muse)

(writer's note: alternation between outside and inside?)

Outside, rain fell from the murky sea of the sky. It was torrential and came down in thick blankets. When they splashed onto the ground, the residual water scattered back into the air and covered the area in a pseudo-fog. Lightning also came down, almost like pepper, down and down to the inviting plate of earth.

Inside, the teacup shook in her hand. Amber liquid rippled along the side of the white, delicate curved walls as Betty Bergeron brought it up to her lips. It was black tea; roasty, intense, and heavy with caffeine. She would've put a dot of milk into the cup, but today's weather seemed oppressive enough that it wouldn't do her good to weigh down her drink further than it already was. And so she continued to take sips, letting her eyes wander across the table in front of her, and the small teaset she's treasured for so many years...

Ladon would criticize her for that. 'I don't see why you couldn't have used your Spout,' he would say, 'Weren't you looking forward to buying it this year?'

She was, indeed. Yet Betty was more human than the legion of the forever young all around her. When novelty came, it was fickle and dangerous. The Spout was beautiful, elegent even, and could produce any drink she wanted given enough time. (In her world, time was yet another free good, like immortality.) An obscure Starbucks order that would never come to see the rain outdoors, let alone the far future? Give it a day and have it steaming fresh in the morning. That's why it was so silly of her to use her teapot. The blood of Christ, the fluid of an extinct animal...unparalled power, and she wouldn't use it more than for water.
