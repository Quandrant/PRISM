## The Various Methods of Magic

_[Universe B]_

Class Magic: Magic that is directly tied to the class of the person. Class Magic acts on the information (quantifiable or qualifiable) in the universe.

1. Seers have Sight. They derive information. They use glasses. 
2. Mages have Addition and Subtraction. They create new information. They use wands.
3. Knights have Concatenation and Permutation. They change and manipulate existing information. They use swords.
4. Thieves have Probability. They alter how information is expressed. They use dice.

Prism Magic: Magic that only changes the universe from the time it's wished. 

Wish Magic: Magic that has the potential to change the universe in a retrocausal way (e.g. "I wish for humans to bleed honey"). Often contained in artifacts like precious jewels or even Class Items.

Null/Void Magic: Not a "true" method of magic, but still noteworthy enough for it's usefulness in counteracting all known magic.

Magical items: Magical items have their own inherent magic that may fall under these categories or none at all
