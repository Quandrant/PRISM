## The Various Methods of Magic

_[Universe B]_

**Note:** With the recent change of scope to Universe B, much of this information may not be relevant. I'm putting this in /Leaves/.

Class Magic: Magic that is tied to the class of the person. Class Magic acts on the information (quantifiable or qualifiable) in the universe, but most expressions of Class Magic are limited to a specific item rather than the whole.

1. Seers have Sight (Division??). They derive information. They use glasses.
     1. e.g. A Seer Sees a plant. They immediately figure out it's a dandelion plant. They could figure out that it's edible, it's yellow, and a weed.
2. Mages have Addition and Subtraction. They create new information. They use wands.
     1. e.g. A Mage Adds the color red to the petals of a plant, but Subtracts the bitter compound left behind on it's pollen. 
3. Knights have Concatenation and Permutation. They change and manipulate existing information. They use swords.
     1. e.g. A Knight Concats the red petals and the yellow pollen of a plant to create red petals with yellow striping and yellow pollen with microscopic red hooks. They can then Permute this Concatenation into many different combinations, like red petals with yellow speckling or red-shelled yellow pollen.
4. Thieves have Probability. They alter how information is expressed. They use dice.
     1. e.g. A Thief looks at the poor plant and decides to fix the damage. 

In the offense-defense-support dichotomy, Thieves are Offense, Knights are Defense, and Seers and Mages are Support.

Prism Magic*: Magic that only changes the universe from the time it's wished.

Wish Magic: Magic that has the potential to change the universe in a retrocausal way (e.g. "I wish for humans to bleed honey"). Often contained in obscure, hidden artifacts like precious jewels or very rare Class Items.

Null/Void Magic: Not considered "magic" by itself; can counteract all known magic.

Magical items: Magical items have their own inherent magic that may fall under these categories or none at all. They are often isolated to a single universe only (looking at you, d.bot constructs), but anything goes--a knife could have the quality to pass through Intersection Points and it will.

\* _Can the new PRISM narrative be considered a product of this Prism Magic? Thankfully, no. Prism Magic is a concept that came from PRISM itself, not the other way around._
