## Ladon Nightshade

[nonchrono]

Ladon was sprawled out in bed.

His eyes flicked around his slice of the cylinder. It was dark out but the moon still shone bright enough to cast strange shadows along the inside of the room. Normally there would be a small lamp next to his bed, but then he remembers that it's somewhere outside at the bottom of the tower after he hurled it out the window in a fit of spite. Orange was--too understanding, and he couldn't take it.

"Why can't you just hate me?" Ladon yelled down the stairs. He would've breathed fire then to seal the deal, but the thick ocean air inside the enclosure prevented any chance of that. The unlit lamp was clutched to his chest, stolen from Orange's ethereal grasp. He could feel the disappointment echo behind him. He couldn't think much about it, though, since a minute later he was already at the top of the lighthouse and...

It would've been so easy to fall, Ladon thought over the chopping water. The lamp fell for him, of course, landed in the deep blue with a resounding splash. Then he remembers getting his head and neck over the railing too, and almost losing balance until that echoing disappointment from before flares into alarm and panic. Orange would be an idiot to let him try and attempt escaping again, so he's thrown to the floor of the deck, muscles shaking against the other person's telekinetic control of the local area.

"Yeah, I would," Orange said aloud. "But I like to think more about your safety than your lust for escaping."

Ladon stopped for a moment to think of a reply. Something acrid, maybe? Today seems a little bitter, though... "You haven't been doing that very well if I want to chuck myself off the railing everytime I remember I'm your *prisoner*."

"You're not a prisoner." Their grasp on Ladon's body falls away in an instant, as if they were embarassed.

"Should I say bargining chip instead?"

A sting of irritation tugged at his navel, then. Ladon feels almost guilty for saying that, but gets up to face them. "We both know Betty would raze me and this lighthouse to the ground if I even mentioned your name, so that's off the table."

"So what am I, Orange?"

In an even colder voice, he responds, "Someone who made a mistake."

The roof begins to turn, and noting the dangerous situation, Ladon scampers down to the next floor into his room. He shuts the door with a click. Seeing the moon rise so fast outside coupled with the moving floor would've been something close to enchanting if he didn't know he pissed off his universe's equivalent of a celestial being. Why wouldn't he be irritated? They've had this argument for weeks and it never went anywhere. It was only natural that the other person's patience would fade out someday.

So now he's under the sheets staring around his wobbly room. The dimensions of the small area never came back right but that was the least of his problems. Orange weighed on their mind like a sack of bricks, and they didn't need to be there discorporating around for him to worry. It shouldn't take someone like them more than two minutes to get the lamp.

A crack of dry lightning
