## Ladon Nightshade

[nonchrono]

Ladon was sprawled out in bed.

His eyes flicked around his slice of the cylinder. It was dark out but the moon still shone bright enough to cast strange shadows along the inside of the room. Normally there would be a small lamp next to his bed, but then he remembers that it's somewhere outside at the bottom of the tower after he hurled it out the window in a fit of spite. Orange was--too understanding, and he couldn't take it.

"Why can't you just hate me?" Ladon yelled down the stairs. He would've breathed fire then to seal the deal, but the thick ocean air inside the enclosure prevented any chance of that. The unlit lamp was clutched to his chest, stolen from Orange's ethereal grasp. He could feel the disappointment echo behind him. He couldn't think much about it, though, since a minute later he was already at the top of the lighthouse and...

It would've been so easy to fall, Ladon thought over the chopping water. The lamp fell for him, of course, landed in the deep blue with a resounding splash. Then he remembers getting his head and neck over the railing too, and almost losing balance until that echoing disappointment from before flares into alarm. Orange would be an idiot to let him try and attempt escaping again, so he's thrown back to the floor of the deck, muscles shaking against the other person's telekinetic control of the local area.

"Yeah, I would," Orange said aloud. "But I like to think more about your safety than your lust for escaping."

Ladon stopped struggling for a moment to think of a reply. Something acrid, maybe? Today seems a little bitter, though... "You haven't been doing that very well if I want to chuck myself outside everytime I remember I'm your *prisoner*."

"You're not a prisoner." Their grasp on Ladon's body fell away in an instant, as if they were embarassed.

"Should I say bargining chip instead?" A sting of irritation tugged at his navel, then. Ladon feels almost guilty for saying that, but gets up to face them.

"We both know Betty would raze me and this lighthouse to the ground if I even mentioned your name, so that's off the table."

"So what am I, Orange?"

In an voice cold enough to freeze Ladon's anger, they responded, "Someone who made a mistake."

Then things started to go fuzzy. Ladon remembers the roof beginning to turn and warp as the night sky and the moon rose up hours before dawn. He definitely dashed past the other person and scampered down the next floor into his room. All of those visuals would've been something close to enchanting if he didn't realize he pissed off his universe's equivalent of a celestial being. Why wouldn't they be irritated? The two of them have had this argument for weeks and it never went anywhere. Ladon never bothered to meet at the middle like Orange did. It was only natural that the other person's patience would fade out someday--the one uncertainty was who.

So now he's under the sheets staring around his wobbly room. The dimensions of the small area never came back right but that was the least of his problems. Orange weighed on his mind like a sack of bricks, and they didn't need to be there discorporating around for him to worry. It shouldn't take someone like them more than a minute to get the lamp off from the ocean floor, but it's been an hour already. 

A crack of dry lightning strikes the glass hull of the building, illuminating Orange's floating figure near the edge of the room. How long have they been there judging Ladon as he rolls through through the shock of the events earlier? But the raw power is crushing and so he turns to the soft sound of fabric moving. Orange is occupied with putting down the pristine lamp on the desk. They go through the motions to light the device, but stops midway with an all too human sigh. The room is still dark save for the small glowing embers in their hair. A small nudge of regret pokes it way towards the front of Ladon's mind, and Orange opens their mouth to speak, but the dragon is the one to put words into the air.

"I'm sorry."

Orange, for all their patience, was never really mad at the person in bed across from them. It was frustrating seeing their guest try to forget all about Betty and
