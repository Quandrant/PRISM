Betty Bergeron stands at the foot of the pastel island. Pale foam laps at the pink sand as she rises out of her boat in rubber boots. The air is cool and dry, and the sun hangs before the horizon wondering if it should dip down slowly or duck in a long swipe. It's a tough decision for the flaming ball of gas, but physics demands decisons, and the earth makes it's move before the sun does. Betty stomps around the island a bit, but it's only until a few minutes has passed that her eyes begin to trail up the spiralling tower.

"Ladon is up there," she says in dismay.

It's honestly ridiculous how he was captured so easily. After all the adventures they've had together, Ladon should have known better than to unsuccessfully wrangle with the Five. *Alone*. Most of Ladon and Betty's encounters with them tend to end in narrowly-accomplished escapes. Still, however, she'll have to send in a complaint ticket to the Five so as to let Ladon struggle a bit before they inevitably take him somewhere. Not that a collective mess of memetic horrors brought to life would care much for a complaint ticket anyhow, but still.

Tired from the trip, Betty plops down onto the sand and turns to face the setting sun. The memory of the tower falls away as the sight of the rose sand and milky white water floods her eyes. It's not a very good sunset. Rather than the multicolored spectacle back at her apartment she's grown to love, there's only a gradient from blue to darker blue here with a string of white dots...wait, it's not dark to see the stars yet.

Raising her head again, she focuses on the constant stream of paper airplanes flying from the very top of the icy tower. They sail away from the tower, over her dilapidated boat, and far away below the horizon. 


Tired from the trip, betty plops down on the sand. she can't help but notice the consistent stream of paper airplanes being thrown from the very top of the icy tower. they sail away from her head, over her dilapidated boat, and off to...somewhere, maybe. (hopefully they don't burn up in the sun. poor ladon.) there's no physical hand giving the fragile items lift, and it's clear they're struggling slightly in the absence of one.

it sure would be nice to give those paper planes some help. betty lifts up her left hand and blows some good wishes into the direction of the single file airforce. almost immediately, they pick up speed--but some veer off course.

it takes a while for one of these stubborn planes to come to her, but when it does, she opens it with barely-hushed alarm. it's ladon's handwriting, but the text on it is incomprehensible. "Nyx still needs to tell [Lux] about the faded constellations. It's hard to tell how we can move on from here. Ask M.Q." it's signed off with the name, Orange. she's never heard of anyone named Orange, but if ladon is has been here long enough that he's made up new names for himself...

it's a childish thought, but betty still suppresses a shiver. it's getting really late. the sun seems to be dipping under the horizon faster than normal. that's not a good sign either, and so, she packs up her items hastily and rushes into the brittle tower.
